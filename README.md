# Comprehensive Analysis of Temperature Trends in Select African Nations (1980–2023)

## Project Overview

This project conducts an in-depth analysis of daily temperature fluctuations—minimum, maximum, and average—across five African countries: Egypt, Tunisia, Cameroon, Senegal, and Angola, spanning the years 1980 to 2023. By examining this extensive dataset, the study aims to identify trends, patterns, and anomalies in temperature changes over time, providing valuable insights into regional climate dynamics.

## Dataset

The dataset encompasses daily temperature records for the specified countries over a 43-year period. Each entry includes:

- **Date:** The specific day of the recorded temperatures.
- **Minimum Temperature:** The lowest temperature recorded on that day.
- **Maximum Temperature:** The highest temperature recorded on that day.
- **Average Temperature:** The mean temperature calculated for that day.

## Objectives

- **Trend Analysis:** Identify long-term temperature trends and assess whether temperatures have been increasing, decreasing, or remaining stable in each country.
- **Seasonal Variations:** Examine seasonal patterns and variations in temperature data.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Detect any significant anomalies or outliers in temperature records that may indicate extreme weather events or data inconsistencies.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Load and clean the dataset to handle missing or inconsistent data entries.
   - Convert date information into a standardized format for time series analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize temperature distributions using histograms and box plots.
   - Plot time series graphs to observe trends and seasonal patterns.
   - Calculate statistical measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation for temperature readings.

3. **Trend Analysis:**
   - Apply moving averages to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
   - Use linear regression models to quantify the rate of temperature change over the years.

4. **Seasonal Decomposition:**
   - Decompose the time series data into trend, seasonal, and residual components to better understand underlying patterns.

5. **Anomaly Detection:**
   - Implement statistical tests to identify days with temperature readings significantly deviating from the norm.
   - Cross-reference anomalies with historical events to contextualize findings.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `numpy` for numerical computations
  - `statsmodels` for time series analysis

## Key Findings

- **Egypt:** Observed a gradual increase in average annual temperatures, with more pronounced warming during the summer months.
- **Tunisia:** Notable rise in maximum daily temperatures, suggesting an increase in the frequency of heatwaves.
- **Cameroon:** Stable average temperatures but with increased variability in daily temperature ranges in recent years.
- **Senegal:** Significant warming trend during the dry season, impacting agricultural practices.
- **Angola:** Fluctuating temperature patterns with no clear long-term trend but noticeable short-term anomalies corresponding to reported drought periods.

## Implications

The analysis provides evidence of climate variability and change in the selected African nations. These findings can inform policymakers, environmentalists, and stakeholders in developing targeted strategies for climate adaptation and mitigation. Understanding temperature trends is crucial for sectors such as agriculture, water resources, and public health.

## Limitations

- **Data Quality:** Potential inaccuracies in historical temperature recordings.
- **Geographical Coverage:** Analysis limited to five countries; results may not be generalizable to the entire continent.
- **External Factors:** The study does not account for external influences such as urbanization or deforestation that may affect local temperatures.

## Future Work

- **Expanded Analysis:** Incorporate additional climatic variables like precipitation and humidity for a more comprehensive climate assessment.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Develop models to forecast future temperature trends based on historical data.
- **Broader Scope:** Extend the study to include more African countries for a continental perspective.
